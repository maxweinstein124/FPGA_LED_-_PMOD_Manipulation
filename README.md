# FPGA_LED_&_PMOD_Manipulation
● Manipulated LEDs to turn all off when Switches 15 & 14 were "00", all on when "01", the value on SW when "10", and toggled at 1Hz when "11". Also printed the value of SW[15:0] on a new line every 5 seconds and created a square wave for the PMOD pins JB(0) (10 Hz) and JB(1) (20 Hz) of the FPGA Board.
